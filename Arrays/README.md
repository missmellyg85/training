# Welcome to Array Methods!

We'll be learning about a few common Javascript Array methods. I recommend approaching your learning in the following order:

1. forEach
2. map
3. filter
4. reduce

# Quick Start

To run a module, you'll need to open your terminal and navigate to the root of this directory. When you're ready to run a file, you can run it with the following command:

```
node FILENAME.js
```
